Update: I ate 3 doug plates, wait containers, (RIP) took an hour nap, and my stomach still hurts to all hell.

Definitely cooked way too hard on the mile. But honestly not bad for the first workout back and being longer distance. The 1200 and 800 splits were off pace but overall everything was there, I guess. The 2400's got really consistent as my pace was consistent for each lap. Did this completely solo on the track and had to zoom around some NARP's who probably thought I was crazy. Doing it solo meant I was pacing it all and couldn't be dragged but had some ups and downs. But overall, it Felt like I just raced as I just laid on the ground for 5 minutes after. How the holy hell did I do this, idk really my guys. Stay tuned when I don't have a track :)

So it seems like the ""track"" that I did this on wasn't exactly a 400M and was over. This is both on Strava and GPS that it is .26mi-.27mi so that's fun. Strava segment seems to have the pace right on so I'll take those which varied from (4:52-5:00) which translates to 73-75 which makes sense
For the .26mi lap, time was 75-77 and Garmin has my paces under 5 minutes so I don't really know. But I was also able to drop a 73 and a 72 at the end so that felt good to give it some gas.
Also, the ""track"" was a gravel track that I had to drive 20 minutes to get to in the burbs. I also had to basically go on the outside the entire time cause old people were slowly jogging on the inside and I didn't have the energy to get them to move.

So, woke up at 9am to get the body ready and eat for my self-projected 12pm start time for the 5k. Was feeling pretty pumped for this with some good music and felt ready to do this time trial. 

Side notes before: I invited my high school friends (some runners, some not) to come out and watch my 5k and come cheer me on even though they can't pace. I told them a 12pm start and they all told me that they would come. My family has one car right now. As well, the track is about 4 miles from me, 10 minute drive.

Here's where it goes to shit. At 11am I start heading out for the track. I go to start the car and it doesn't start. oof #1. We call a tow and they say that the car won't be ready until tomorrow. oof #2. As it is getting to 11:30, I say fuck it and order an Uber cause I don't want to be late for the time I gave. oof #3. 

Note: I am trying to practice social distancing to the best of my ability but I was really trying to get this in and was desperate. 

Ok so, I get in the uber and get to track at 11:50. Nobody is there. oof #4. I shake it off and say they'll get here while I'm doing my warmup, no problem. Get back at 12:10, still nobody is there. oof #5. Get only one text from my friend who can't come because his dad is being cautious with his asthma. oof #6. I love this guy and I'm ok with him cause he texted me and I know he's really at risk. 

Put the work in, got the schmoney, gave the track the schmoke. 

If I knew that people weren't coming, I would have just done it in the streets by my house and not had to deal with all this shit. oof #7. Not driving there means I gotta get back so I say FUCK IT, and just do my cooldown WITH MY BAG OF ALL MY STUFF. oof #8. Then walk the rest of the way back. oof #9. But the walk wasn't bad cause I got iced coffee on the way back and listened to some good music for 4 miles. 

If you read that, damn thank you. Just need to get that out and that I'm really missing you guys.

Was able to hit the track for this one. Surprised myself a little with how well it went. Was aiming for a 15:30-15:45 which is what the running thing predicted but I'll take this cause it is a 5k PR by 20 seconds from cross pre-season and my 3 mile time was also a PR by ~25 seconds. Also disappointed I didn't go sub-16.

So today, Ye by Kanye West. Put this album on queue just to listen to and liked it. I know people aren't a fan of this album, as it doesn't feel like Kanye but this was a good mellow album that is very instrumental based. Also, this album reminds me of that sad injury time so it has a nostalgia factor. Ghost Town is the best song but All Mine is also very good. This album lacks in its opener and closer, as they are both underwhelming. The album just feels incomplete and isn't connected in anything except sound.

3452054626,"May 14, 2020, 8:05:13 PM",Purple Moonlight Pages - R.A.P. Ferreira,Run,"This week is Purple Moonlight Pages, a hip-pop jazz album made by RAP Ferreira. This album lived off of the sound and the different  instruments. It kept me engaged the entire time as each song the beat, instruments, and flow changed. The use of that smooth saxophone and then the inclusion of various trumpets along with the so solid drums in the back and then the delight of the piano sounds. Each song was produced so well and you can tell in the sounds of Noncipher, An Idea is a work of art, and Mythical . Where Noncipher has that sax sound, An Idea is a Work of Art with the piano and drums, and then Mythical combines all of my favorite sounds from the album. 
Lyrically, the album has some super super high points. Decorum opens the album so well, and Cycles just keeps the theme of having art in the world is what we have to use to fight. Cause we can't fight with money or power but we can fight with words and show the truth and that's the most important. And No Starving Artists continues with this theme that we need artists and art because they are so valuable. And then Master Plan finishes the album so perfectly. He sings about how the world is this beautiful place and that as long as we have music and art that the world will prosper and be happy because of that music.
However, there were also some songs that were ok and I felt like they didn't contribute much. Laundry makes sense that he is forced to do laundry to make money but there's a point where he is just saying laundry for 30 seconds. As well, Pinball was ok, again lyrically bland and didn't make sense.

Overall, this album was pretty good and the themes were so solid and meaningful and then the sounds just created such an amazing background to the beauty of the lyrics.

This week was IGOR by Tyler the Creator. Imo this was a massive set up from Flower Boy and felt like his best work by miles. I wasn't disappointed by any song except New Magic Wand. Igor's theme is a very good opener and establishes this new sound of the album. The Earfquake hits you like a truck of absolute VIBES. Such a catchy sound that just establishes that this album is going to be a great hip-hop/pop album that combines the interesting and experimental sounds and catchiness of pop while also having that personality from the artist. The bangers continue with I Think and A Boy is a Gun. We get to see some lyrics now from Tyler and his love life while also being able to head bang the hell out of this. The story is being told of this one relationship as he is falling in love but violence eventually gets in the way, which is seen in the following songs up to a Boy is a Gun. Then we hit the backend after he does what he has to do to survive that he ruined that relationship but he is thankful for everything that the person did. And eventually wants forgiveness. The album theme is kinda spelled out. But you get it. 
The sounds also just hit different and the album overall is a banger and a half.

ASTROWORLD by Travis Scott is up this week. Another well renowned album and more experimentation in this psychedelic hip-hop genre which really fits Travis's style imo. However, I found myself continuing to dip in and out of listening to the music. I was really engaged and pumped up when some of his bangers were playing, and he has a TON on this album. Stargazing, Sicko Mode, Skeletons,  Wake Up, 5% Tint, NC-17, Can't Say, Yosemite. But as good as these songs were, I found the other songs to be equally bad or uninteresting. It had that style and beat that I liked but there wasn't anything special. The beat switches on Sicko Mode with Drake's features swept that song. And the instrumentals on the other songs gave such a hype feeling or a calm, smooth, psychedelic feeling. But the other songs didn't do either and didn't accomplish much.
I still have to give credit for how well this album is made and the absolute energy it gives off. Some songs are even on playlists so ASTROWORLD will never leave.

Solid workout today especially with the weather being very iffy. The first rep is probably more impressive since I had a 20MPH headwind. Was scared that I was going to get dumped on since it was drizzling for the WU but then it stopped after a few minutes so I was vibing for that.

Today was another one of Kanye, The Life of Pablo. Maybe it's cause it's nostalgia of freshman year but nonetheless good album. Ultralight Beam starts the album hard with what can be compared to a Jesus is King song but like 1000x better. Then Father Stretch my Hands pt.1 is something. One hand it's great to sing and rave to but the lyrics are iffy. We all know what bars I'm talking about. Then pt.2 is trash, desiigner ain't good and that holds true for this song. After famous, we get into this weird section, where it's just soft reflection but also like cursing his family and shit. Then waves is some steak sauce, good instrumentals and good enough lyrics. Then we have some more reflective songs which are good examples of solid experimentation from Kanye. After the sounds of Wolves, we get my favorite section of album starting at No More Parties in LA up to Saint Pablo. No More Parties in LA is criminally underrated and needs some more love. Overall, the album is kinda all over the place but it makes sense as well, you can absolutely vibe to it.

So Ventura, after having recently finding Paak, took this 30 min album for a ride and I enjoyed this listen very much. It was a superb R&B influenced hip hop album that had some amazing instrumentals on the keyboard and drums. And the vocals were also a soothing but engaging voice. Some really good songs but then some were also lackluster at points but very solid.
Verdict: 7.5/10
Now, Pop Smoke. A complete 180 to some of the best trap music I have heard in a while. As Pop Smoke died soon after MTW2, this posthumous album is very posthumous as the features are everywhere. To the point where Pop Smoke is barely rapping in some songs. But when he does, lord it is some fire. His bars go off and he delivers them all flawlessly. Aim for the moon, Gangstas, Snitching, The Woo were the highlight songs as this album has a good mix of new trap sounds and the traditional ones. I would have loved to listen to the growth of this sound.

I will like to formally apologize for taking us out in a sub-70 but my race tactic was go hard or go home, be aggressive and taking a commanding lead. Had that for the first mile and I was feeling really confident as we were clicking 72's. Then Sam passed me and gave me an extra competitive drive but then come lap 7 I wanted to get back in front and lead but every straightaway I couldn't pass and would tuck behind for the turn. This happened for 3 laps and honestly destroyed my mentality. I think I had the lead for lap 8+9, I run 10 seconds faster. That would have been a great confidence booster but alas, it is a mistake that I'm able to learn from.
Also, preparation was really really wonky today and I think that contributed. Slept less than 5 hours cause I was an anxious mess. Went to bed really ready and fresh then woke up and had some heavy ass legs. The strides just felt, heavy and way too much work. As well, breakfast plan was bad too cause Doug didn't open until 8 and didn't eat a lot. But my stomach felt so full leading up to the race, and just felt like throwing up leading up to the race. 
But enough complaining, another PR and another good day of competitive racing. Felt really happy that I was able to push Sam to a really good PR, and happy how long I lasted

Some tactical moments to improve but also some things I did well. Got choppy after the 100m cause I got boxed in with the one guy going too slow then the field closing in on the right. This forced a lane 2 move after the 250 and then made sure to get on second's shoulder just like I wanted to. After the 600, I went side to side with second which was needed for being in heat 1 cause heat 2 had the ability to adapt to our times. Then at ~850, went ahead and then had a good decision not to chase the guy way in front cause I would bridged the gap and put more energy than needed for myself to be in a good position. Rolling at 1100, picked it up and held off the pack until 1450 where three went ahead but I was still able to qualify as the next guy didn't hit ahead. 58.8 closing which isn't awful but could be better, but then again it's what needed.
